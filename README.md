# üèÉ gofer-release üèÉ
[Bosh](https://bosh.io) release for [Gofer](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/gofer). Gofer is kind of like [Kuryr](https://github.com/openstack/kuryr) for [Cloud Foundry](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release) [container networking](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/netman-release)

Kuryr means *messenger*, Gofer means *"go for"*

This release is a prototype for CF container networking using:
- [CNI](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni) plugin:
  - [Neutron](https://github.com/openstack/neutron) API for control plane (create networks,subnets,ports)
  - [Keystone](https://github.com/openstack/keystone) API for authentication
  - uses a delegate openvswitch (OVS) CNI plugin for VIF binding
- tested using a local [devstack](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/devstack/) for Neutron, Keystone
